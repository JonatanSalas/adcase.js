Rich Media, Debug and Modern DFP Implementations
======================================================

- Adcase.io script simplifies the use of both Rich Media and display creatives in Double Click for Publishers (DFP).
- It provides a builder application to help build rich media creatives that work seamlessly in DFP, with no technical coding knowledge needed.
- It is a high performance solution that uses secure safeframes, for standard websites as well as for single page apps and PWAs.
- It can create debug screens for both desktop and mobile web, that work on actual mobile devices and can be used by non technical users.
- Adcase.io can be implemented with standard DFP tags (light version), full new modern dfp tags (full version) or even **no tags** (for real).
