Adcase.io  - Rich media, debug and modern tags for DFP
======================================================

Adcase.io script simplifies the use of both Rich Media and display creatives in Double Click for Publishers (DFP). 

It provides [a builder application](https://builder.adcase.io) to help build rich media creatives that work seamlessly in DFP, with no technical coding knowledge needed.

It is a high performance solution that uses secure safeframes, for standard websites as well as for single page apps and PWAs. 

It can create debug screens for both desktop and mobile web, that work on actual mobile devices and can be used by non technical users.

Adcase.io can be implemented with standard DFP tags (light version) or full new modern dfp tags (full version).

This is not an official Google product, and it is also not officially supported by Google.
